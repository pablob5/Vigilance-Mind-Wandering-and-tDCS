# Vigilance and Mind Wandering, a tDCS study

During prolonged tasks, vigilance tends to decline gradually, a phenomenon known as the "vigilance decrement".
The main objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of HD-tDCS in mitigating the vigilance decrement and mind wandering during prolonged tasks. We aim to identify which of these approaches is more effective in mitigating the vigilance decrement
